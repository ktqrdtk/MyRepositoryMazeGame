# MyRepositoryMazeGame

A game where mazes are randomly stichted together to form a larger maze that you travel through.
For use: put the MazeGame.jar file and the MazesFolder in the same directory then run (double click) the MazeGame.jar file.
Controls are w, a, s, d. The goal is to visit all of the smaller mazes in as little time as possible.
Once you have visited a maze it will start blinking.
Also, if you would like to make your own mazes use the MazeToText.jar, when you finish transfer the MazeX.txt into the MazesFolder then rename MazeX to Maze5 or whatever the next number in the folder is.
